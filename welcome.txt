Welcome to the installer. Let me guide you real quick.

We offer two installation options here: Container and Standard Server:

- Container installation is faster because it removes heavy service 
controls and MySQL server, which means it requires less workload and 
is ideal for lightweight deployment. However, it still requires the 
same minimum packages as the Standard Server installation.
- Standard Server option is perfect for those looking for a fully 
functional SaaS. It includes MySQL server, systemd service control, 
and more secure HTTPS support.
